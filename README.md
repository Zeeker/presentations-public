# Talks

This repository contains all presentations I've prepared for various talks in my free time. The slides are written in Markdown using [Sublime Text][sublime-text] and rendered via [Deckset][deckset].

Each talk follows this basic file and structure:

- `<talk-name>.md` the "raw" markdown for the slides
- `build/` exported PDFs via [Deckset][deckset]
- `examples/` any examples used in the talk, e.g. recorded via [`asciinema`][asciinema]
- `images/` any images used in the talks
