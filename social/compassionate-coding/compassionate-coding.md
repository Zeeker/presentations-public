# Compassionate Coding
### _being more humane in tech_

^
Thank you for being here! My name is Sascha, backend dev/tsa @grandcentrix in cologne

With that out of the way: Let's get going!

![](images/communication.jpg)

^
Communication: Transfering information from one person to another

^
All our jobs include it:
- Meetings: Daily/Planning/Retro
- Digital: Jira/Confluence/Slack

^
The thing is, we in tech are all about solving problems

---
![](images/problem-solving.jpeg)

^
Solving problems in an efficient manner; we talk a lot about
- Efficent Code
- Time Management
- High Velocity

^
Of course that also means we want to have ...

---
## Efficient
# Communication

^
And for a lot of people that means ...

---
## Brisk & Direct
# Communication

^
In this talk I would like to pose the question, if ...

---
##  Brisk & Direct?
# Communication

^
most efficient way?

---
# Let's start
### _small_

---
![](images/code-reviews.jpeg)

^
Let me ask you a question ...

---
# Who here had a <br/> *negative experience* <br/> in a code review?

![](images/sad.jpeg)

^
hurt; left back a bad feeling/bad taste; didn't feel quite right

^
So what? Some might say ...

---
> People need a thicker skin!
-- Somebody

---
> It's not my job to care about others feelings!
-- Somebody

---
> That's the way tech works!
-- Somebody

^
I used to think like that!

^
It doesn't have to be that way!

---
# What if I told you <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> There is an *alternative*

![](images/what-if-I-told-you.jpg)

---
# Compassion

![](images/compassion.jpeg)

^
Definition: the feeling that arises when you are confronted with another’s suffering and feel motivated to relieve that suffering.

^
Compassion != Empathy != Pity
=> You want to DO something!

^
How might that look like in Code Reviews?

---
# How about some examples?

^
I went through my own personal history of code reviews

---
## I'm gonna eat my own dogfoot

---
# Passing of Opinion as Fact

---
# Passing of Opinion as Fact[^1]

<br/><br/><br/>

^
What's the problem with this?

^
No backup (docs, guidelines etc.). Personal preference is not enough!

^
How might an alternative look like?

---
# Compassionate Alternative

> The Phoenix docs suggest to move persistence related functionality into a so called "Context" ([see here](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/contexts.html)). I think that's applicable here and would improve the project structure. What do you think?
-- A better me

^
Better!
- Links to docs
- Explains why
- Asks for feedback

---
# Asking judgmental questions

---
# Asking judgmental questions[^1]

<br/><br/><br/>

![inline](images/reviews/why-not-use.png)

^
Implies solution should be obvious => Person is dumb to not see it

^
Veiled demands => Instead provide recommandations (links)

---
# Compassionate Alternative

> You could move this into a view, which has the benefit of separating the "response building" from the "rendering" logic.
-- A better me

^
There are other things: Too much for this lightning talk!

^
Some of you might ask yourself: Why should I care?

---
# [fit] `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

^
That's certainly a valid question! Why should we?
No Advantage = No Reason

^
Because it leads to better collaboration

---
![](images/collaboration.jpeg)

^
~5 minutes
Ask youself: Which of the comments above would have had more of an impact on you?

^
Not convinced? In 2012 Google embarked on journey to answer the following question ...

---
> What's the secret to <br/> a successful team?
-- Google (Project Aristotle)

^
2 years of research
- 200+ interviews (employees)
- 180+ active teams
- 250 different attributes

^
In the end it boiled down to something called:

---
# Psychological Safety

---
# Psychological Safety

> [the] shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. [...]
> A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up.
-- Amy Edmondson (Harvard Business School)

^
What does that mean?
- A protected environment to exchange ideas
- Healthy culture around failure
- A lot more things: article from NY Times!

^
How to build it? One approaching could be COMPASSION

---
![](images/rainbow.gif)

^
Be more compassionate in code reviews and all problems are fixed?

^
Compassion in Code Reviews = Profit? No

---
## Of course
# Code Reviews
## are just a small part

---
## But they are a
# great start

^
Now that you might have an impression why these ideas are important ...

---
## Let's go
# [fit] _big_

^
And by that I mean, let's talk about ...

---
# The Tech Industry

^
At large ...
Because you see, right now ...

---
## We in the tech industry value
# intelligence

---
### We talk about
# ROCKSTAR DEVS
### and
# CODE NINJAS

---
## We make fun of
# "untechnical" people

^
Things like: "The customer requested the source code in a PDF!"

^
It IS pretty funny but let me ask you:

---
## But what does
# *technical*
## actually mean?

---
# Technical

>  having special and usually practical knowledge especially of a mechanical or scientific subject
-- Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary

^
Interesting: "especially" not "exclusively"

---
# Technical

>  having special and usually practical knowledge __especially__ of a mechanical or scientific subject
-- Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary

^
Based on that: what would be some examples

---
[.build-lists: true]

# Technical Examples

- Programming Python
- Accounting in EXCEL
- Using Photoshop
- Dancing Disco Fox

---

# Technical Examples

- Programming Python
- Accounting in EXCEL
- Using Photoshop
- Dancing Disco Fox
- Using chopsticks/a fork[^2]

[^2]: https://medium.com/compassionate-coding/if-you-can-use-a-fork-youre-technical-352e21d92c87

^
Pretty much any learned skill!

^
"Not technical" = "Not versed in MY technical stuff"

^
But as we just discussed:

---
## Being
# technical & intelligent
## isn't everything

![](images/technical.jpeg)

---
## Being
# compassionate
## counts too

![](images/compassion.jpeg)

^
As a rule of thumb: Avoid triggering thread responses
- You can handle criticism? Great! Others might not!
- Try to leave them better!

^
Let's use this knowledge and ...

---
## Let's build
# psychological safe
## environments

^
For ...
- Better Teams
- Efficient Communication

^
I want to close this talk with a quote from the person who inspired me to do this:

---
# Be the change ❤️

> The tech industry — and the world — is made up of individual humans, and a lot of those humans are suffering. Each of us has the opportunity to do something about it.
-- April Wensel (Compassionate Coding)[^3]
