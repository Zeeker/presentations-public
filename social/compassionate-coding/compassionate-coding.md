# Efficient Communication?
## Brisk & Direct

# Who here had a <br/> *negative experience* <br/> in code reviews?

^
Doesn't have to be @GCX
hurt; left back a bad feeling; didn't feel quite right

^
A lot if it probably came from the other trying to be efficient

## The tech industry values
# intelligence

---
### We "worship"
# ROCKSTAR DEVS
### and
# CODE NINJAS

---
## We laugh about
# "untechnical" people

---
## But what does
# *technical*
## actually mean?

# Confessions of a Recovering Jerk Programmer[^1]

> I also spoke to people as if they were computers, and if they got upset, I decided that’s their own fault for not being able to manage their emotions.

> So, I'm not allowed to critique people any more?

# Compassion and not "ruinous empathy"

> Compassion presents an optimization problem — it’s about understanding and minimizing suffering. It’s not the same as politeness or niceness, and it often involves speaking honestly and assertively.
-- April Wensel (Compassionate Coding)

---
# Efficient Communication!

> Eventually, I realized that taking time to care about other people’s emotions isn’t just kind — it’s actually more efficient if it leads to smoother interactions that don’t trigger people’s threat responses.
-- April Wensel (Compassionate Coding)

# Be the change ❤️

> The tech industry — and the world — is made up of individual humans, and a lot of those humans are suffering. Each of us has the opportunity to do something about it.
-- April Wensel (Compassionate Coding)
