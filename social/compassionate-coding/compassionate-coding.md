# Compassionate Coding
### _being more humane in tech_

^
Thank you for being here!
I want to start this talk about ...

---
# Communication

![](images/communication.jpg)

^
The act of ...

---
# Communication
### Transfering information from one person to another

^
All our jobs include some form of communication
- Customer contact
- Daily/Planning/Review/Retro etc.
- Jira/Confluence/GitHub and of course

^
The thing is ...

---
## The tech industry is about
# Solving Problems
## in an efficient manner

^
"Holy Grail" of the Tech Industry
- Efficent Code
- Time Management
- High Velocity

^
Of course that also means we want to have ...

---
## Efficient
# Communication

^
And for a lot of people that means ...

---
## Brisk & Direct
# Communication

^
I would like to pose the question, if ...

---
## Brisk & Direct
# Communication
## = Efficient?

^
Lot of "Bla Bla" ... Let's get more close to reality ...
Let me ask you a question ...

---
# Who here had a <br/> *negative experience* <br/> in a code review?

^
Doesn't have to be @GCX
hurt; left back a bad feeling; didn't feel quite right

^
I would bet that a lot of it was about being efficient! But ...

---
# We are not machines

---
# People are different

^
Some of you probably now think ...

---
![](images/duh.gif)

^
Thanks, Captain Obvious!

^
But in practice that means ...

---
# The things you mean might not be the things the other person understands

^
Just because you can handle brisk critism doesn't mean the other can ...

^
Even if you mean well ...
- They might have a difficult time in life
- Their pet might be sick
- They might just have a bad day

^
Maybe you think ...

---

# They just need </br> a thicker skin!

^
I certainly did that in the past!

^
Why am I telling you all of this?

---
> Does that mean <br/> I'm no longer allowed <br/> to criticise people?
-- Somebody

^
Of course not! Feedback is important! (Mention talk on feedback?)

^
I'm here to suggest ...


---
# What if I told you <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> There is an *alternative*

![](images/what-if-I-told-you.jpg)

# Compassion

^
Woho! Magic Sauce! Everything is saved!

^
Ofc we are not going to get there with this, so ...

![](images/rainbow.jpeg)

## How about some examples in the context of Code Reviews?

^
I looked at our GitHub and picked out a few comments ...

^
But no worries! I'm not gonna blame anyone! Instead ...

---
## I'm gonna eat my own dog food

^
What does that mean? You'll see in a sec ...

^
Let's start with this one ...

---
# Passing of Opinion as Fact

# Passing of Opinion as Fact[^2]

^
What's the problem with this?

^
No backup (docs, guidelines etc.). Personal preference is not enough!

^
How might a compassionate alternative look like?

---
# Compassionate Alternative

> The Phoenix docs suggest to move persistence related functionality into a so called "Context" ([see here](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/contexts.html)). I think that's applicable here and I think will improve the project structure. What do you think?
-- A better me

^
Better!
- Links to docs
- Explains why
- Asks for feedback

---
# Asking judgmental questions

---
# Asking judgmental questions[^2]

<br/><br/><br/>

![inline](images/reviews/why-not-use.png)

^
Implies solution should be obvious => Person is dumb to not see it

^
Veiled demands => Instead provide recommandations (links)

---
# Compassionate Alternative

> You could move this into a view, which has the benefit of separating the "response building" from the "rendering" logic.
-- A better me

^
I think you get the point

---
# Is it easy? No.
# Is it worth it? Yes!

^
It leads to ...

---
# Better Collaboration

^
And to have a quote in here ...

---
# Compassion - an optimization problem

> Compassion presents an optimization problem‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs about understanding and minimizing suffering. It‚Äôs not the same as politeness or niceness, and it often involves speaking honestly and assertively.
-- April Wensel (Compassionate Coding)[^1]

[^1]: https://medium.com/compassionate-coding/confessions-of-a-recovering-jerk-programmer-b9d531a05ea9

^
And we like Optimization Problems, right?

---
## Of course
# Code Reviews
## are just a small part

---
## But they are a
# great start

^
In the end it boils down to ...

---
## Try to leave your colleagues better

^
If we can do that, we can talk about the bigger issue

---
## Now that we discussed
# Compassion
## in Code Reviews

---
## Let's talk about the
# Big Picture

^
And by that I mean ...

---

# The Tech Industry

^
Because you see, right now ...

---
## We in the tech industry value
# intelligence

---
### We talk about
# ROCKSTAR DEVS
### and
# CODE NINJAS

---
## We make fun of
# "untechnical" people

^
Things like: "The customer requested the source code in a PDF!"

^
It IS pretty funny but we should keep one thing in mind ...

---
## But what does
# *technical*
## actually mean?

^
I looked it up on Wiktionary and this is what came out of it

---
# Technical

> Of or pertaining to the useful or mechanic arts, or to any academic, legal, science, engineering, business, or the like terminology with specific and precise meaning or (frequently, as a degree of distinction) shades of meaning; specially appropriate to any art, science or engineering field, or business
-- Wiktionary

^
I'll just gonna let you read it

---
![](images/wat.jpg)

^
Maybe let's use some examples

---
## Maybe some examples are better ...

---
# Technical Examples

- Programming Python
- Using Photoshop
- Accounting in Excel
- Dancing Disco Fox
- Using a Fork

^
Sooo ...

---
[.build-lists: false]

# Technical Examples

- Programming Python
- Using Photoshop
- Accounting in Excel
- Dancing Disco Fox
- Using a Fork

<br/>__Pretty much any learned skill__

^
Also ...

---
## Being
# technical & intelligent
## isn't everything

---
## What about
# Emotional Intelligence?

^
Because ... If you think about it ...

---
### If you think about it
# Compassion
### is all about
# Emotional Intelligence

---
## It's not only about "being nice"

---
## It actually leads to better
# Collaboration

^
Or as April Wensel put it ...

---
# Smoother Interactions

> Eventually, I realized that taking time to care about other people‚Äôs emotions isn‚Äôt just kind‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs actually more efficient if it leads to smoother interactions that don‚Äôt trigger people‚Äôs threat responses.
-- April Wensel (Compassionate Coding)[^1]

^
And here we are again. Full circle back to ...

---
## Efficient
# Communication

^
I want to close this talk with a final quote

---
# Be the change ‚ù§Ô∏è

> The tech industry‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the world‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis made up of individual humans, and a lot of those humans are suffering. Each of us has the opportunity to do something about it.
-- April Wensel (Compassionate Coding)[^1]
