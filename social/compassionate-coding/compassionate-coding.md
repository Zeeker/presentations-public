Thank you for being here!
I want to start this talk about ...

# Communication

<image?>

^
All our jobs include some form of communication
- Customer
- Requirements gathering
- Jira/Confluence/GitHub/Code Reviews and more

^
It's all about ...

# Communication
### Transfering information from one person to another

---
## The tech industry is about
# Solving Problems
## in an efficient manner

^
"Holy Grail" of the Tech Industry
- Efficent Code
- Time Management
- High Velocity

# Efficient Communication

^
And a lot of that boils down to ...

---
# Efficient Communication
## Brisk & Direct

# Efficient Communication?
## Brisk & Direct

---
# Who here had a <br/> *negative experience* <br/> in code reviews?

^
Doesn't have to be @GCX
hurt; left back a bad feeling; didn't feel quite right

^
A lot if it probably came from the other trying to be efficient

# We are not machines

# People are different

# Just because *you* <br/> can handle brisk <br/> criticism doesn't <br/> mean the other can

# Confessions of a Recovering Jerk Programmer[^1]

> I also spoke to people as if they were computers, and if they got upset, I decided that’s their own fault for not being able to manage their emotions.

# Compassion and not "ruinous empathy"

> Compassion presents an optimization problem — it’s about understanding and minimizing suffering. It’s not the same as politeness or niceness, and it often involves speaking honestly and assertively.
-- April Wensel (Compassionate Coding)

# Efficient Communication

> Eventually, I realized that taking time to care about other people’s emotions isn’t just kind — it’s actually more efficient if it leads to smoother interactions that don’t trigger people’s threat responses.
-- April Wensel (Compassionate Coding)

# Be the change ❤️

> The tech industry — and the world — is made up of individual humans, and a lot of those humans are suffering. Each of us has the opportunity to do something about it.
-- April Wensel (Compassionate Coding)
