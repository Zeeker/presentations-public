# You know nothing ... or do you?

## Part 1 - Knowledge

- Well of Wisdom available
  + Some numbers, Wikipedia articles, hours of videso on YouTube etc.
  + Answers in depth which blow your mind
  + Sometimes we don't even know how to phrase a question
- Afraid of making mistakes
  + People are smarter than me
  + Better be quiet, don't want to embarrass myself
  + Wait until I learned things
  + Impatient responses
- There is always a way of doing things better
  + Code I've written yesterday is shit tomorrow
  + "I would like to rewrite this"
- So. Much. To. Learn.
  + Use Docker, urg you're using Angular, React is the shit! No use PureScript!
  + A pile of unread books
  + Reading lists, colleagues sharing etc.
- Burnout
  + Stress over unknowns
  + Pressure to perform __and__ learn
  + Unable to take a break

## Part 2 - A new frame of mind

- Hi, I'm Sascha (only introduce technical me)
  + Full-Stack Dev/TSA from cologne, germany
  + grandcentrix, system integrator, #IoT
  + Know my way around: git, cli magic, Clean Code, TDD
- What makes a good software developer? [INTERACTIVE?]
  + Tech Skills
  + Super productive
  + High quality
  + Super fast learner (meta, lol)
  + "We talk about Rockstar Devs / Code Ninjas"

*Order TBD*
- Development = Learning & Code = Distilled Knowledge
  + Of course we can't know everything!!! We're learning!
- Not soft skills = core skills
- Other skills = complementary
  + INTERACTIVE: Who here knows dancing, cooking, plays an instrument, etc.
- You're more than a walking tech stack!
  + @GCX first check: Does this person fit on a personal level? Only after that tech check
- Productive Team = Psychological Safety (Google Research)
  + Not the "best" / "smartest" people
  + Most safe environment!
- We are not perfect, quite the opposite: we're fundamentally flawed
  + Not being "perfect" is bad. Whay?
  + Perfect is boring: Nobody likes that guy
  + Everybody fucks up (Maybe gather some funny examples?)

- What really makes a good software developer?
  *Think of someone you really, truly respect*
  + Patience (with tech, colleagues etc.)
  + Communication Skills (understanding and communicating requirements)
  + Being a decent human being
- Hi again, I'm still Sascha (wholesome me)
  + Full-Stack Dev/TSA/Husband/Roleplayer
  + Married, father of a two year old
  + Avid roleplayer and gamemaster
  + Know my way around: (all of the above) + rpgs, game design, sci-fi

## Part 3 - Tips & Tricks

*Probably short and sweet this one; unstructured right now, gathering ideas*

- Document the Journey, not the Goal
- Ask colleagues what they would ask you
- Create a TIL-List
- "I did the best I could with the knowledge I had"
  + Could've written this better at that point in time? (prob not)
- Fokus on what you learn, not what you didn't know
  + Not "I can't make mistakes" but "I learned X for the future!"
- Write down what you want to learn + estimates = Ridiculous!
- Pile of unread books = [Antilibrary](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/24/umberto-eco-antilibrary/) (?)
- Meditate (?)
