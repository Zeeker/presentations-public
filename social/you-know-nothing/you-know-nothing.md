# [fit] You Know Nothing

Tried to make accessible: Give me feedback! (Thanks to organizers!)

Ask: Who in this room is not a dev?
Talk: From a perspective of a dev; gist is applicable regardless of profession, don't feel excluded!

# Knowledge Sharing

What is it?
- Writing blog posts
- Answering Questions
- Recording videos or podcasts
- Speaking on conferences
- Teaching your colleagues

^
Agree that it's important
We all rely on it, colleagues, or through platforms such as ...

# __Intimidating__

You read these articles or answers and these people seem so smart.
What could we possibly contribute? Right?

^
We already struggle to keep up

![original](images/dev-word-cloud-4.png)

^
So. Much. To. Learn.

Then we try to keep up and maybe ask people questions and they tell us:

This forms our perception of the job as a dev; we could come to the conclusion that a great dev knows all that

---
# A Great Developer

- Awesome tech skills
- Incredible productivity
- High quality code
- Blazing fast learner
- Some Soft skills

^
At the end it's all about the output, right?

^
So we're thinking ...

---
# *Keep learning*

^
So we can become great devs and at some point have something to share

^
When we're doing that, we're trying to avoid ...

---
## We're afraid of
# __Embarrassment__

^
All boils down to this
We don't want to be "that person"


---
# So we __don't__ ...

- answer that StackOverflow question
- do that talk on that meetup
- offer that help to someone
- prepare that workshop
- record that video
- write that blog post
- give input during that meeting

---
# Who could blame us?

---
## We're working in a
# __fast__ moving
## industry

^
Which means, we're pressured to

---
# Perform
# __and__
# Learn

^
Both at the same time; this stresses us out
So we just don't do it. Maybe we write a blog post but never publish it

---
# Sounds familiar?

Can be a colleague, blogger, youtuber, etc.

Ask yourself: What exactly do you respect about them?

## Which qualities do you respect?

- Writes awesome code?
- Great communication skills?
- Empathic and patient?
- Fun to interact with?
- Interested in a variety of topics?
- Prompts you to learn new things?
- Probably lots of other things!

^
Code: Only that? Or maybe more?

^
The point I'm trying to make: Rarely only tech skills which we respect!

Stable foundation: It's harder to shake you!
When you share, and it's wrong, it's not so bad!

^
I urge you:
Don't try to be a "Rockstar Dev"
=> Be a "Wholesome Dev"

## Focus on the
# __Learnings__
## not the
# __Mistakes__

^
Not “I can’t make mistakes” but “I learned X for the future!”

On the same note:

## We did the
# __best__
## we could

^
... with the knowledge we had

^
Code is distilled knowledge; writing it is a learning process
Old Code = What did I learn till then? (Maybe eben worthy of a blog post?)

## Keep a
# __TIL__
## Record

And do not focus on tech only!
They're great seeds for future talks, blog posts etc.

And now to a fun one:

## Ask
# __colleagues__
## what they would
# __ask you__

^
Again: Don't focus on tech only!
Funny: Ruby on Rails, wat?
New: Productivity Tooling

^
This teaches us two things:
1. You seem knowledgeable to people
2. Our perception of knowledge might be faulty

- Questions you had and their answers
- Reference for you
