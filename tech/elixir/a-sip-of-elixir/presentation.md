Q: Familiarity

^
Why almost? According to Dr. Carl Hewitt (inventor of the actor model in 1973)
Why? Because Erlang was designed without it's knowledge

- Actor = fundamental unit of computation
- Isolation (shared nothing) - immutable data
- Message passing
- Sequential processing

^
When message arrives (one of):
- Create more actors
- Send messages to other actors
- Designate what to do with the next message = Mutate State

A VM; just like the JVM

---
### _Ruby_
#### +
### _Erlang_
#### =
## **_Elixir_**

^
With the history out of the way, let's talk specifics

^
First: Whirlwind tour of syntax

---
# _Syntax_ Crashcurse

---
[.autoscale: true]
[.list: alignment(left)]

# _Syntax_ Crashcurse - Basic Types

- _List:_ `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`
- _Map:_ `%{key: "value"}`
- _Atom:_ `:an_atom`
- _Boolean:_ `true || false`
- _Tuple:_ `{"have some PI", 3.1415, :the_pi_is_a_lie}`
- _Function:_ `fn x, y -> x * y end`

^
Excluded the "obvious" stuff: numbers, strings, etc.

^
Atoms: Constants, some languages call them symbols (like Ruby) - booleans are atoms
Useful for pattern matching

^
Functions = Anonymous functions

---
[.autoscale: true]
[.list: alignment(left)]

# _Syntax_ Crashcurse - Operators

- _Basics:_ `+, -, *, /, ==, <, >, &&, ||`
- _String Concatination:_ `"Hello" <> " Lambda Cologne"`
- _List Concatination:_ `[3, 1, 4] ++ [1, 5]`
- _Pipe:_ `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5] |> Enum.map(fn x -> x * 2 end) |> Enum.sum()`

---
# _Syntax_ Crashcurse - Pipe
<br/>

[.code-highlight: 1-2]
[.code-highlight: 4-5]
```elixir
iex> [3, 1, 4, 1, 5] |> Enum.map(fn x -> x * 2 end) |> Enum.sum()
28

iex> Enum.sum(Enum.map([3, 1, 4, 1, 5], fn x -> x * 2 end))
28
```

^
Remember? Immutable data! That's why pipe is so useful

^
Alternative: variables, variables, variables (which is what you see in Erlang)

---
# **_Elixir_**

- developer happiness
- pattern-matching
- syntactic macro system
- Erlang goodness

---
# _Developer_ Happiness

---
## _Great_ Tooling

- build tool `mix`
- code formatter
- unit testing framework
- first-class documentation
- and more ...

^
All maintained by the core team

^
Not gonna talk about `mix` and formatter

---
## Unit Testing Framework
### _`ExUnit`_

---
[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 6]
```elixir
defmodule GreetingsTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  test "it greets friendly" do
    assert Greetings.hello("Lambda Cologne") ==
             "Hello Lambda Cologne!"
  end
end
```

^
`async: true` because code is pure

^
*Highlight change with laser: "!" at the end*

^
Test failure looks like this:

---
[.background-color: #191918]

![inline](images/exunit-test-failure.png)

^
Tells us about the code, the left value, the right value etc.

^
"Knows" we used `==`: How?
Syntactic Macro System - `assert` is a macro

---
## First-Class _Documentation_

^
Okay, what does that mean?

---
[.hide-footer]

![](images/writing-docs.png)

^
Elixir takes good docs seriously

---
```elixir
defmodule Greetings do
  @doc """
  Prints a friendly greeting.

  ## Examples

      iex> Greetings.hello("Lambda Cologne")
      "Hello Lambda Cologne!"
  """
  def hello(name) do
    IO.puts("Hello #{name}")
  end
end
```

^
First: docs are **not** comments

^
`@doc` is a **module attribute**; basically a module-level constant

---
[.background-color: #191918]

![inline](images/iex-docs.png)

^
Neat but not **that** impressive

---
[.hide-footer]

![](images/exdoc.png)

---
```elixir
defmodule GreetingsTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  doctest Greetings
end
```

---
[.background-color: #191918]

![inline](images/exunit-doctest-test-failure.png)

---
# And _more_ ...

- Powerful interactive console (`iex`)
- "Batteries included" web framework (Phoenix)
- A bunch more neat Erlang/OTP things:
- Supervision trees, observer, remote debugging, hot code upgrades ...

^
iex: Auto-complete, great data inspection, docs, command history etc.

^
Phoenix: We're gonna hear a bit more about this from Peter, I think

---
# _Pattern_
# Matching

^
Q: Who here is familiar with pattern matching? (FP-ler should?)

^
Similar: Destructuring?

^
Example: List

---
```elixir
iex> my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
iex> [first, second | rest] = my_list
iex> first
3
iex> second
1
iex> rest
[4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
```

^
Example: Map (or Dict/Hash)

---
```elixir
iex> my_map = %{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
iex> %{a: a, b: b} = my_map
iex> a
1
iex> b
2
```

^
Example: Strings

---
```elixir
iex> greeting = "Hello Lambda Cologne"
iex> "Hello " <> name = greeting
iex> name
"Lambda Cologne"
```

^
Usually you think of `=` as the "Assignment Operator"

---
# _`=`_
#### is the
## ~~_Assignment_ Operator~~
## _Match_ Operator

^
Match left side against right side

^
What happens when it can't match?

---
```elixir
iex> "Hello " <> name = "Salut Lambda Cologne"
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: "Salut Lambda Cologne"
    (stdlib) erl_eval.erl:453: :erl_eval.expr/5
    (iex) lib/iex/evaluator.ex:257: IEx.Evaluator.handle_eval/5
    (iex) lib/iex/evaluator.ex:237: IEx.Evaluator.do_eval/3
    (iex) lib/iex/evaluator.ex:215: IEx.Evaluator.eval/3
    (iex) lib/iex/evaluator.ex:103: IEx.Evaluator.loop/1
    (iex) lib/iex/evaluator.ex:27: IEx.Evaluator.init/4
```

---
## _Pattern_ Matching
## is everywhere

---
```elixir
defmodule Greetings do
  def hello("") do
    hello("anonymous")
  end

  def hello("Lambda " <> city) do
    hello("FP-Enthusiast from #{city}")
  end

  def hello(name) do
    "Hello #{name}!"
  end
end
```

^
Clauses are "tried" in order of declaration

^
Pretty common pattern (not the stupid greetings):
Multiple clauses matching and calling each other

^
I could talk more about pattern matching but we have limited time ...

---
# _Syntactic_
# Macros

^
Depending on time ...
Q: Macros or high-level patterns?

^
Q: Who knows what that is?
Q2: Who knows what macros are?

---

### Transform the
# _AST_
#### _A_bstract _S_yntax _T_ree

^
C-Macros: Fancy string replacement

^
Languages: Lisp (most well-known), Rust, Elixir, and more
Lisp: Basically write the AST directly

^
Why is that cool?

---
### Use the
##_full power_
### of
## **_Elixir_**

^
Let's have an example ...

---
```elixir
defmodule Conditional do
  defmacro if(condition, do: true_block, else: false_block) do
    quote do
      case unquote(condition) do
        true -> unquote(true_block)
        false -> unquote(false_block)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

^
`quote` and `unquote` = string + interpolation for code (AST)

---
```elixir
iex> import Conditional
iex> if true do
...>   "dis is true"
...> else
...>   "dis is false"
...> end
"dis is true"
```

^
Elixir has an `if` and it's a macro

---
```
application/andrew-inset      ez
application/applixware        aw
application/atom+xml        atom
application/atomcat+xml       atomcat
application/atomsvc+xml       atomsvc
application/ccxml+xml       ccxml
application/cdmi-capability     cdmia
application/cdmi-container      cdmic
application/cdmi-domain       cdmid
application/cdmi-object       cdmio
application/cdmi-queue        cdmiq
application/cu-seeme        cu
```

^
Left: Mime Type | Right: Extension

---
```elixir
defmodule MimeType do
  "path/to/mime-types.txt"
  |> File.read!()
  |> Enum.map(fn line ->
    [mime_type, extension] = String.split(line, " ", trim: true)

    def to_extension(unquote(mime_type)), do: unquote(extension)
  end)
end
```

---
```elixir
iex> MimeType.to_extension("application/applixware")
"aw"
```

---
## **_Elixir_** Macros
## are _hygenic_

^
Hygenic: Variables declared in Macros don't pollute the caller context

^
Example: x in caller, x in macro, doesn't override

---
# _Erlang_ goodness

^
What does that mean?

---
```erlang
-module(greetings).
-export([hello/1]).

hello(Name) ->
    io:format("Hello ~s~n", [Name]).
```

---
```elixir
defmodule Greetings do
  def hello(name) do
    :greetings.hello(name)
  end
end
```

^
A lot of Elixirs std just delegates to Erlang
Example: Enum.reverse

^
Not unlike the state of languages on the JVM

> If half of Erlang's greatness comes from its concurrency and distribution and the other half comes from its error handling capabilities, then the OTP framework is the third half of it.

^
At the core of most Elixir applications
Because: the basic building block is a

---
# _Process_
#### Actor

^
OTP provides a framework on how to structure your processes

^
Example:

---
# _Database_ Connection

^
What would be tasks?

---
# _Database_ Connection
<br/>

- establish a connection
- do some work*
- disconnect

---
[.build-lists: false]

# _Database_ Connection
<br/>

- establish a connection
- run a query*
- disconnect
<br/>

<sup>* Usually you would have some kind of checkout/checkin mechanism</sup>

^
INIT: establish a connection
SYNC: run a query*
ASYNC: disconnect

---
[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 2]
[.code-highlight: 4-8]
[.code-highlight: 10-14]
[.code-highlight: 16-20]
```elixir
defmodule DbConnection do
  use GenServer

  def init(uri) do
    connection = MyDatabase.establish_connection(uri)

    {:ok, connection}
  end

  def handle_call({:query, query}, _from, connection) do
    result = MyDatabase.run_query(connection, query)

    {:reply, result, connection}
  end

  def handle_cast(:disconnect, connection) do
    connection = MyDatabase.close_connection(connection)

    {:stop, :normal, connection}
  end
end
```

^
`use GenServer`: "use" is a macro, injects some boilerplate

^
`init`, `handle_cast`, and `handle_call` are callbacks from the GenServer "behaviour" (interfaces)

---
```elixir
iex> {:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(DbConnection, "my-database-uri")

iex> query = "SELECT * FROM users"
iex> GenServer.call(pid, {:query, query})
[ ... ] # List of users

iex> GenServer.cast(pid, :disconnect)
:ok
```

^
Quite boilerplaty, that‚Äôs why you often see this ...

---
```elixir
defmodule DbConnection do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(uri) do
    GenServer.start_link(DbConnection, uri)
  end

  def query(pid, query) do
    GenServer.call(pid, {:query, query})
  end

  def disconnect(pid) do
    GenServer.cast(pid, :disconnect)
  end

  # init, handle_call, handle_cast
end
```
