# _Actor_ Model[^2]

[^2]: `Technically almost-actor (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0m0_qtfzLs)`

^
Q: Familiarity

^
Why almost? According to Dr. Carl Hewitt (inventor of the actor model in 1973)
Why? Because Erlang was designed without it's knowledge

^
- Actor = fundamental unit of computation
- Isolation (shared nothing)
- Message passing
- Sequential processing

^
When message arrives (one of):
- Create more actors
- Send messages to other actors
- Designate what to do with the next message = Mutate State

---
## _Erlang_ was created
## at _Ericsson_ for
## _telephony switches_

---
- Distributed
- Fault-tolerant
- Soft real-time
- High-availability

^
- Light processes
- Hot-code reloading
- self-recovering

---
## Work on
## _Erlang_ started
## in _1987_

---
## It went
## _open-source_
## in _1998_

---
## _Battle-tested_
## in over _30 years_
## of _usage_

^
Sounds pretty good, right?

^
BUT ...

---
```erlang
-module(greetings).
-export([hello/1]).

hello(Name) ->
    io:format("Hello ~s~n", [Name]).
```

^
Syntax: Prolog-inspired
Not a bad language, but takes some getting used to
Old language which you notice

Ruby = Developer productivity and happiness

^
Erlang = Powerful and battle-hardened concurrency

---
![](images/cant-we-have-both.gif)

^
Remember, Erlang runs in a VM

---
# _BEAM_

^
A VM; just like the JVM

---
```erlang
-module(greetings).
-export([hello/1]).

hello(Name) ->
    io:format("Hello ~s~n", [Name]).
```


---
```elixir
defmodule Greetings do
  def hello(name) do
    IO.puts("Hello #{name}")
  end
end
```

^
`#{name}` = string interpolation

### _Ruby_

### _Erlang_
#### =
## **_Elixir_**

^
With the history out of the way, let's talk specifics

---
# **_Elixir_**

- Erlang goodness
- developer happiness
- pattern-matching
- syntactic macro system

---
# _Erlang_ goodness

^
What does that mean?

---
```erlang
-module(greetings).
-export([hello/1]).

hello(Name) ->
    io:format("Hello ~s~n", [Name]).
```

---
```elixir
defmodule Greetings do
  def hello(name) do
    :greetings.hello(name)
  end
end
```

^
A lot of Elixirs std just delegates to Erlang
Example: Enum.reverse

^
Not unlike the state of languages on the JVM

# _OTP_

# _O_pen _T_elecom _P_latform

> If half of Erlang's greatness comes from its concurrency and distribution and the other half comes from its error handling capabilities, then the OTP framework is the third half of it.

At the core of most Elixir applications

If we have time, I'll talk about these at the end

---
# _Developer_ Happiness

---
## _Great_ Tooling

- build tool `mix`
- code formatter
- unit testing framework
- first-class documentation
- and more ...

^
All maintained by the core team

^
Not gonna talk about `mix` and formatter

---
## Unit Testing Framework
### _`ExUnit`_

---
[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 6]
```elixir
defmodule GreetingsTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  test "it greets friendly" do
    assert Greetings.hello("Lambda Cologne") ==
             "Hello Lambda Cologne!"
  end
end
```

^
`async: true` because code is pure

^
*Highlight change with laser: "!" at the end*

^
Test failure looks like this:

---
[.background-color: #191918]

![inline](images/exunit-test-failure.png)

^
Tells us about the code, the left value, the right value etc.

^
"Knows" we used `==`: How?
Syntactic Macro System - `assert` is a macro

---
## First-Class _Documentation_

^
Okay, what does that mean?

---
[.hide-footer]

![](images/writing-docs.png)

^
Elixir takes good docs seriously

---
```elixir
defmodule Greetings do
  @doc """
  Prints a friendly greeting.

  ## Examples

      iex> Greetings.hello("Lambda Cologne")
      "Hello Lambda Cologne!"
  """
  def hello(name) do
    IO.puts("Hello #{name}")
  end
end
```

^
First: docs are **not** comments

^
`@doc` is a **module attribute**; basically a module-level constant

---
[.background-color: #191918]

![inline](images/iex-docs.png)

^
Neat but not **that** impressive

---
[.hide-footer]

![](images/exdoc.png)

---
```elixir
defmodule GreetingsTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  doctest Greetings
end
```

---
[.background-color: #191918]

![inline](images/exunit-doctest-test-failure.png)

---
# And _more_ ...

- Powerful interactive console (`iex`)
- "Batteries included" web framework (Phoenix)
- A bunch more neat Erlang/OTP things:
- Supervision trees, observer, remote debugging, hot code upgrades ...

^
iex: Auto-complete, great data inspection, docs, command history etc.

^
Phoenix: We're gonna hear a bit more about this from Peter, I think

---
# _Pattern_
# Matching

^
Q: Who here is familiar with pattern matching? (FP-ler should?)

^
Similar: Destructuring?

^
Example: List

---
```elixir
iex> my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
iex> [first, second | rest] = my_list
iex> first
3
iex> second
1
iex> rest
[4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
```

^
Example: Map (or Dict/Hash)

---
```elixir
iex> my_map = %{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
iex> %{a: a, b: b} = my_map
iex> a
1
iex> b
2
```

^
Example: Strings

---
```elixir
iex> greeting = "Hello Lambda Cologne"
iex> "Hello " <> name = greeting
iex> name
"Lambda Cologne"
```

---
## _Pattern_ Matching
## is everywhere

---
```elixir
defmodule Greetings do
  def hello("") do
    hello("anonymous")
  end

  def hello("Lambda " <> city) do
    hello("FP-Enthusiast from #{city}")
  end

  def hello(name) do
    "Hello #{name}!"
  end
end
```

^
Clauses are "tried" in order of declaration

^
Pretty common pattern (not the stupid greetings):
Multiple clauses matching and calling each other

^
I could talk more about pattern matching but we have limited time ...

# _Syntactic_
# Macros

^
Q: Who knows what that is?
Q2: Who knows what macros are?

---

### Transform the
# _AST_
#### _A_bstract _S_yntax _T_ree

^
C-Macros: Fancy string replacement

^
Languages: Lisp (most well-known), Rust, Elixir, and more
Lisp: Basically write the AST directly

^
Why is that cool?
