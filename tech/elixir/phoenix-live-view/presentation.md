# [fit] Beyond the SPA
## [fit] __Interactive web apps without writing JS__

<!--
- Static vs dynamic web sites (left static, right google maps)
- "So we have to write JS"
- What technology to chose? React, Vue, Angular, Svelte ...
- There is even a website to help you choose
- What else to consider? State handling, routing etc.
- Webpack ...
- Communication between front- and backend: API definitions, websockets for realtime etc.
- Sometimes this complexity makes sense but sometimes ... (Admin Dashboard, Fun Retro)
- Enter Phoenix LiveView
- DEMO
- How does it work?
- Initial full render (SEO-friendly), socket connection afterwards
- Change Tracking via Live EEX, tech agnostic (static and dynamic)
- Efficient DOM updates (morphdom)
- Phoenix Sockets scale very well (2 mio connections, link to blogpost)
- OTP's actor model uniquely suited
- When to use: Anything with simple interactivity and realtime updates, MVPs, reduction of complexity
- When not to use: offline capability, lots of "client-side" logic
- Conclusion: Phoenix LiveView fills a gap between static and full blown SPA

- everything was static
- nothing reacted
- nothing happened

And that's not even considering:

# [fit] <video: number of packages on npm growing over the years>

^
- state handling
- routing (if SPA)
- thousands of other packages

Hashtag: JS Fatigue
Slide on Webpack?

## What about the
# __backend__?

^
- API documentation
- Websockets for server-triggered updates

---

> Is all of this *really* necessary?
-- An overwealmed dev

<!-- TODO: Check if spelling correct! -->

^
- Huge additional tech stack
- Loads of complexity

Sometimes it makes sense: Google Docs, Maps, Games, etc.

Examples:
- Dashboards
- Trello, Fun Retro
- Pushing updates from the server

## Isn't there an __alternative__?

Initial render means it's super SEO friendly
