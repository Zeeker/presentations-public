Well, Erlang is a compiled language

---
# _BEAM_
#### _Erlang_ VM

^
A VM; just like the JVM

^
And THIS (Erlang)
Became THIS (Elixir)

---
```erlang

```

defmodule Greetings do

# _Functional_ Language

<br/>
> Avoid mutation and side effects.
-- Richard Feldmann[^1]

[^1]: https://youtu.be/QyJZzq0v7Z4

^
How well does the language support this style?

^
How to avoid mutation?

---
# _Immutability_

^
Let's look at a simple example

---
```ruby
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.concat([4, 5, 6])
puts(my_list.inspect)


=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

^
Same piece of code in Elixir

---
```elixir
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
Enum.concat(my_list, [4, 5, 6])
IO.inspect(my_list)


=> [1, 2, 3]
```

^
What you actually need to do

---
```elixir
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list2 = Enum.concat(my_list, [4, 5, 6])
IO.inspect(my_list2)


=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

^
Some of you might now ask themselves:

---
# But _why_?

^
Highest source of concurrency bugs?

^
Erlang highly concurrent
Concurrency + Immutability = Perfect Match

^
There is some mutation (later!)

---
```elixir
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list2 = Enum.concat(my_list, [4, 5, 6])
my_list3 = Enum.concat(my_list2, [7, 8, 9])
IO.inspect(my_list3)


=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

^
Variables all over the place = annoying

^
(actually what Erlang code looks like)

---
### Enter the
## _Pipe_
### Operator

---
```elixir
[1, 2, 3]
|> Enum.concat([4, 5, 6])
|> Enum.concat([7, 8, 9])

=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

^
Optimizations: pointing to old data (can't change!)

---
# _Syntax_?

^
Stop me immediately when some language construct is unfamiliar! I'll explain

---
## _Design Aspects_
### of
## _**Elixir**_

---
# _Design Aspects_

- _functional_ language
- _developer_ happiness
- _pattern_ matching
- _syntactic_ macros

# _Developer_ Happiness

---
[.autoscale: true]

## _Great_ Tooling

- build tool _`mix`_
- code _formatter_
- interactive console (_`iex`_)
- unit testing framework
- first-class _documentation_

^
All maintained by the core team

^
Not gonna talk about `mix` and formatter
iex: Auto-complete, great data inspection, docs, command history etc.

---
## Unit Testing Framework
### _`ExUnit`_

---
[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 6]
```elixir
defmodule GreetingsTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  test "it greets friendly" do
    assert Greetings.hello("Web Engineering D√ºsseldorf") ==
             "Hello Web Engineering D√ºsseldorf!"
  end
end
```

^
`async: true` because code is pure

^
*Highlight change with laser: "!" at the end*

^
Test failure looks like this:

---
[.background-color: #191918]

![inline](images/exunit-test-failure.png)

^
Tells us about the code, the left value, the right value etc.

^
"Knows" we used `==`: How?
Syntactic Macro System - `assert` is a macro

---
# First-Class
# _Documentation_

^
Okay, what does that mean?

---
[.hide-footer]

![](images/writing-docs.png)

^
Elixir takes good docs seriously

---
```elixir
defmodule greetings do
  @doc """
  prints a friendly greeting.

  ## examples

      iex> greetings.hello("web engineering d√ºsseldorf")
      "hello web engineering d√ºsseldorf!"
  """
  def hello(name) do
    io.puts("hello #{name}")
  end
end
```

^
First: docs are **not** comments

^
`@doc` is a **module attribute**; basically a module-level constant

^
Can be accessed easily

---
[.background-color: #191918]

![inline](images/iex-docs.png)

^
Neat but not **that** impressive

---
[.hide-footer]

![fill](images/exdoc.png)

^
All published packages get their docs automatically generated that way
https://hexdocs.pm/

---
[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 7-8]
```elixir
defmodule Greetings do
  @doc """
  prints a friendly greeting.

  ## Examples

      iex> greetings.hello("web engineering d√ºsseldorf")
      "hello web engineering d√ºsseldorf!"
  """
  def hello(name) do
    Io.puts("hello #{name}")
  end
end
```

---
```elixir
defmodule GreetingsTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true

  doctest Greetings
end
```

---
[.background-color: #191918]

![inline](images/exunit-doctest-test-failure.png)

---
# _Pattern_
# Matching

^
Q: Who here is familiar with pattern matching? (FP-ler should?)

^
Similar: Destructuring?

^
Example: List

---
```elixir
iex> my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
iex> [first, second | rest] = my_list
iex> first
3
iex> second
1
iex> rest
[4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
```

^
Example: Map (or Dict/Hash)

---
```elixir
iex> my_map = %{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
iex> %{a: a, b: b} = my_map
iex> a
1
iex> b
2
```

^
Example: Strings

---
```elixir
iex> greeting = "Hello Web Engineering D√ºsseldorf"
iex> "Hello " <> name = greeting
iex> name
"Web Engineering D√ºsseldorf"
```

^
Usually you think of `=` as the "Assignment Operator"

---
# _`=`_
#### is the
## ~~_Assignment_ Operator~~
## _Match_ Operator

^
Match left side against right side

^
What happens when it can't match?

---
```elixir
iex> "Hello " <> name = "Salut Web Engineering D√ºsseldorf"
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: "Salut Web Engineering D√ºsseldorf"
    (stdlib) erl_eval.erl:453: :erl_eval.expr/5
    (iex) lib/iex/evaluator.ex:257: IEx.Evaluator.handle_eval/5
    (iex) lib/iex/evaluator.ex:237: IEx.Evaluator.do_eval/3
    (iex) lib/iex/evaluator.ex:215: IEx.Evaluator.eval/3
    (iex) lib/iex/evaluator.ex:103: IEx.Evaluator.loop/1
    (iex) lib/iex/evaluator.ex:27: IEx.Evaluator.init/4
```

---
# TODO:
## Some more slides on Pattern Matching

---
## _Pattern_ Matching
## is _everywhere_

---
```elixir
defmodule Greetings do
  def hello("") do
    hello("anonymous")
  end

  def hello("Web Engineering " <> city) do
    hello("Web Folks from #{city}")
  end

  def hello(name) do
    "Hello #{name}!"
  end
end
```

^
Clauses are "tried" in order of declaration

^
Pretty common pattern (not the stupid greetings):
Multiple clauses matching and calling each other

^
I could talk more about pattern matching but we have limited time ...

---
# _Syntactic_
# Macros

^
Depending on time ...
Q: Macros or high-level patterns?

^
Q: Who knows what that is?
Q2: Who knows what macros are?

---
### Transform the
# _AST_
#### _A_bstract _S_yntax _T_ree

^
C-Macros: Fancy string replacement

^
Languages: Lisp (most well-known), Rust, Elixir, and more
Lisp: Basically write the AST directly

---
```elixir
iex> quote do
...>   IO.puts("Hello " <> name)
...> end
{{:., [], [{:__aliases__, [alias: false], [:IO]}, :puts]}, [],
 [{:<>, [context: Elixir, import: Kernel], ["Hello ", {:name, [], Elixir}]}]}
```

^
Elixir code represented as Elixir data structures

^
Why is this cool?

---
### Use the
##_full power_
### of
## **_Elixir_**

^
Code as data structures => Manipulate it!

^
Let's have an example ...

---
```elixir
defmodule Conditional do
  defmacro if(condition, do: true_block, else: false_block) do
    quote do
      case unquote(condition) do
        true -> unquote(true_block)
        false -> unquote(false_block)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

^
`quote` and `unquote` = string + interpolation for code (AST)

---
```elixir
import Conditional
if Date.utc_today() == ~D[2019-12-12] do
  IO.puts("Meetup time!")
else
  IO.puts("No meetup :("))
end

=> Meetup time!
```

^
Elixir has an `if` and it's a macro
as is the pipe operator

---
```
application/andrew-inset      ez
application/applixware        aw
application/atom+xml        atom
application/atomcat+xml       atomcat
application/atomsvc+xml       atomsvc
application/ccxml+xml       ccxml
application/cdmi-capability     cdmia
application/cdmi-container      cdmic
application/cdmi-domain       cdmid
application/cdmi-object       cdmio
application/cdmi-queue        cdmiq
application/cu-seeme        cu
```

^
Left: Mime Type | Right: Extension

---
```elixir
defmodule MimeType do
  "path/to/mime-types.txt"
  |> File.read!()
  |> Enum.map(fn line ->
    [mime_type, extension] = String.split(line, " ", trim: true)

    def to_extension(unquote(mime_type)), do: unquote(extension)
  end)
end
```

---
```elixir
iex> MimeType.to_extension("application/applixware")
"aw"
```

^
Other examples: Phoenix templates => inlined

---
## **_Elixir_** Macros
## are _hygenic_

^
Hygenic: Variables declared in Macros don't pollute the caller context

^
Example: x in caller, x in macro, doesn't override

---
```elixir
defmodule MyMacros do
  def define_x(value) do
    quote do
      x = unquote(value)
    end
  end
end

iex> import MyMacros
iex> x = 42
iex> define_x(1337) # x = 1337
iex> IO.puts(x)

=> 42
```

^
Macros are very powerful, but ...

---
[.hide-footer]

![](images/great-power.gif)

^
The Community agrees: Use Macros sparingly

^
They can make code imcomprehensible

---
# _Erlang_ goodness

---
# _BEAM_
#### _Erlang_ VM

^
First of all, you can use Erlang code from Elixir

---
# _Code_ Reuse

^
Remember the `greetings` code from earlier?

---
```erlang
-module(greetings).
-export([hello/1]).

hello(Name) ->
    io:format("Hello ~s~n", [Name]).
```

---
```elixir
defmodule Greetings do
  def hello(name) do
    :greetings.hello(name)
  end
end
```

^
A lot of Elixirs std just delegates to Erlang
Example: Enum.reverse

^
Not unlike the state of languages on the JVM

^
Second ...

# _Concurrency_

^
The BEAM is "based" on the ...

---
# _Actor_ Model[^2]

[^2]: `Technically almost-actor (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0m0_qtfzLs)`

^
Q: Familiarity

^
Why almost? According to Dr. Carl Hewitt (inventor of the actor model in 1973)
Why? Because Erlang was designed without it's knowledge

---
[.background-color: #ffffff]
[.footer-style: #000000]
[.footer: `source: https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/`]

![inline](images/actor-model.png)

^
- Actor = fundamental unit of computation
- Isolation (shared nothing) - immutable data
- Message passing
- Sequential processing

^
When message arrives (one of):
- Create more actors
- Send messages to other actors
- Designate what to do with the next message = Mutate State

---
# _Process_
#### Actor

^
Not OS level process but a lot more lightweight

---
```elixir
pid = spawn(fn ->
  receive do
    {:ping, from} -> send from, :pong
  end
end)
send pid, {:ping, self()}
flush() # Prints all messages in the inbox

=> :pong
```

^
Obviously you don't want to build everything using `spawn`

^
That's why Erlang ships with ...

---
# _OTP_
#### _O_pen _T_elecom _P_latform

---
# _O_pen _T_elecom _P_latform

> If half of Erlang's greatness comes from its concurrency and distribution and the other half comes from its error handling capabilities, then the OTP framework is the third half of it.
-- Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good! (Frederic Trottier-Hebert)[^3]

[^3]: https://learnyousomeerlang.com/what-is-otp

^
OTP provides a framework on how to structure your processes

^
At the core of most Elixir applications

^
Example:

---
# _Database_ Connection

^
What would be tasks?

---
[.text-strong: #1F223D, League Gothic]

# _Database_ Connection
<br/>

- establish a _connection_
- run a _query___*__
- _disconnect_

^
INIT: establish a connection
SYNC: run a query*
ASYNC: disconnect

---
[.build-lists: false]

# _Database_ Connection
<br/>

- establish a _connection_
- run a _query_*
- _disconnect_

<br/><sup>* Usually you would have some kind of checkout/checkin mechanism</sup>

^
OTP Abstraction:

---
# _Gen_Server

^
Name is fitting

---
[.code-highlight: all]
[.code-highlight: 2]
[.code-highlight: 4-8]
[.code-highlight: 10-14]
[.code-highlight: 16-20]
```elixir
defmodule DbConnection do
  use GenServer

  def init(uri) do
    connection = MyDatabase.establish_connection(uri)

    {:ok, connection}
  end

  def handle_call({:query, query}, _from, connection) do
    result = MyDatabase.run_query(connection, query)

    {:reply, result, connection}
  end

  def handle_cast(:disconnect, connection) do
    connection = MyDatabase.close_connection(connection)

    {:stop, :normal, connection}
  end
end
```

^
`use GenServer`: "use" is a macro, injects some boilerplate

^
`init`, `handle_cast`, and `handle_call` are callbacks from the GenServer "behaviour" (interfaces)

---
```elixir
iex> {:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(DbConnection, "my-database-uri")

iex> query = "SELECT * FROM users"
iex> GenServer.call(pid, {:query, query})
[ ... ] # List of users

iex> GenServer.cast(pid, :disconnect)
:ok
```

^
Quite boilerplaty, that‚Äôs why you often see this ...

---
```elixir
defmodule DbConnection do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(uri) do
    GenServer.start_link(DbConnection, uri)
  end

  def query(pid, query) do
    GenServer.call(pid, {:query, query})
  end

  def disconnect(pid) do
    GenServer.cast(pid, :disconnect)
  end

  # init, handle_call, handle_cast
end
```
