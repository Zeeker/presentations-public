## Meet Alex
# üë®‚Äçüíª

---

# Alex is a developer

---

## He just started at this
# cool company

^
Let's call them ...

---

# Smallcentrix

---

## They are pretty big on
# Clean Code

---

## He starts working
## on his first project

---

## They tell him to
# write tests

^
No experience doing that

---

# :scream:

---

![](images/no-idea.gif)

---

## Alex asks himself
# Why?

---

> It costs time!

---

> It's annoying!

---

> I can test manually!

---

## But he starts to write tests

---

## <angry typing gif>?

^
This is ...

---

## It's painful

---

## The tests are brittle

---

## Break with the smallest change

---

## Take a lot of time to maintain

---

## And are hard to read

---

## Alex is frustated

---

# <rage.gif>?

---

## A senior developer
## approaches him

# Test Pyramid

- Few manual tests
- Some Acceptance/UI Tests
- More Integration Tests
- A lot of Unit Tests

![right 100%](images/test-pyramid.png)

---

# Acceptance Tests
## UI Tests

---

# Acceptance/UI Tests

- High-level testing
- Ensure requirements are being fulfilled
- A topic on it's own

^
~10%
Not focussing on this

---

# Integration Tests

---

# Integration Tests

- Test parts working together
- Black box testing
- Have no assumptions about inner workings
- Only test input and output of the system

^
~20%
Relevant, but we'll focus on

---

# Unit Tests

- Test single "units" in __isolation__
- Independent from each other
- Good unit tests act as ...
  + design specifications
  + documentation

^
~70%
You might ask, and Alex does too, ...

---

> What makes a good Unit Test?
-- Alex

---

> To understand that we first have to look at units.
-- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

> You need to understand how to write testable units.

# Example

---

```python
def get_time_of_day():
  now = datetime.now()

  if now.hour >= 0 and now.hour < 6:
    return "night"
  elif now.hour >= 6 and now.hour < 12:
    return "morning"
  elif now.hour >= 12 and now.hour < 18:
    return "afternoon"

  return "evening"
```

    return "morning"
  elif now.hour >= 12 and now.hour < 18:
    return "afternoon"

  return "evening"

What does that mean? It should cover a "particular behaviour" of your code

# Side Effects

^
Ask for definition

---

# Example

---

```python


class AlarmController:
  def motion_detected(self, datetime):
    if AlarmController.is_night(datetime):
      AlarmSiren.get_instance().activate()

  @staticmethod
  def is_night(datetime):
    return get_time_of_day(datetime) == "night"
```

^
`AlarmSiren` is a singleton

---

```python


class AlarmControllerTest(unittest.TestCase):
  def setUp(self):
    self.alarm_controller = AlarmController()

  def test_motion_detected_at_2_activates_alarm(self):
    self.alarm_controller.motion_detected(today_at(2))

    # How to test that the alarm went off?
    self.assertTrue(False)
```

---

> Any ideas on

Next slide is solution

---

```python
class AlarmController:
  def __init__(self, alarm):
    self.alarm = alarm

  def motion_detected(self, datetime):
    if AlarmController.is_night(datetime):
      self.alarm.activate()

  @staticmethod
  def is_night(datetime):
    return get_time_of_day(datetime) == "night"
```

---

```python
class FakeAlarm:
  activated = False

  def activate(self):
    self.activated = True


class AlarmControllerTest(unittest.TestCase):
  def setUp(self):
    self.alarm = FakeAlarm()
    self.alarm_controller = AlarmController(self.alarm)

  def test_motion_detected_at_2_activates_alarm(self):
    self.alarm_controller.motion_detected(today_at(2))
```

# Summary

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Side Effects / Side Causes
- Testing units in isolation
- And of course Don't Repeat Yourself

---

> Of course, there are a lot more things.
-- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

> Writing good tests is not easy.
-- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

> But it's worth the effort.
-- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# We gain

- Composable units
- Behaviour specifications (basically a contract)
- Refactoring safety
