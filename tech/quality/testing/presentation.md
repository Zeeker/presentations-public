## Alex asks himself
# Why?

---

> It costs time!

---

> It's annoying!

---

> I can test manually!

---

## But he starts to write tests

---

## <angry typing gif>?

^
This is ...

---

## It's painful

---

## The tests break with the smallest change

---

## They take a lot of time to maintain

---

## They are hard to read

---

## Alex is frustated

# Test Pyramid

- A lot of Unit Tests
- Less Integration Tests
- Even less Acceptance/UI Tests
- Some manual tests

![right 100%](images/test-pyramid.png)

---

# Acceptance Tests
## UI Tests

---

# Acceptance/UI Tests

- High-level testing
- Ensure requirements are being fulfilled
- A topic on it's own

^
~10%
Not focussing on this

---

# Integration Tests

---

# Integration Tests

- Test parts working together
- Black box testing
- Does not care about inner workings

^
Relevant, but we'll focus on

---

# Unit Tests

- Test single "units" in isolation
- Independent from each other
- Good unit tests act as ...
  + design specifications
  + documentation

^
You might ask, and Alex does too, ...

---

> What makes a good Unit Test?
-- Alex

---

> First you need to understand how to write testable units

## Inline Images

When using the **[inline]** modifier, images automatically centre and fit to the available space.

![inline](http://deckset-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/colnago2.jpg)

---

![inline, left](http://deckset-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/colnago2.jpg)

Use **[inline, left]** or **[inline, right]** to move images around. With the text underneath like this, it is the simplest ways to add captions to images.
