1. "random" backend developer in a "random" company using Elixir
2. "We need more diagnostics in the backend!"
  - event sourced, cqrs (commanded), phoenix
3. What options are there? What can I use?
4. "Look into OpenTracing, you must"
5. OpenTracing: Vendor-neutral APIs and instrumentation for distributed tracing
6. Otter, ExRay more?
7. "Woho! Working Prove of Concept!"
8. Integrate tracing without much code changes?
  - Carriers in OpenTracing, no support in Otter
  - Global State? ets table? When to clean
  - Solution: Per-Process Span stack
9. Request -> Command
10. "What about Command -> Command and Command -> Projection?"
11. "Carrier"-like: Injected trace IDs into command/event metadata
12. Trace: Request -> Command -> Projections / Commands (?)

## Inline Images

When using the **[inline]** modifier, images automatically centre and fit to the available space.

![inline, left](http://deckset-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/colnago2.jpg)

Use **[inline, left]** or **[inline, right]** to move images around. With the text underneath like this, it is the simplest ways to add captions to images.

# Tables

With `:---:`, `---:` and `:---` you can center, right or right align the cell content.

  Header 1 |    Header 2   |   Header 3   |
-----------| :-----------: | -----------: |
Cell       |     _Cell_    |     *Cell*
Cell       |   **Cell**    |     __Cell__
